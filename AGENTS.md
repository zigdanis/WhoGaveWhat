## Cheap Subagent Workflow

Codex may delegate scoped low-risk work to OpenCode through `codex-cheap`.

Use it for focused implementation from a clear spec, mechanical refactors, simple searches, test runs, and failure summaries.

Do not use it for secrets, auth, deployment, destructive commands, broad architecture, or ambiguous product decisions.

Command:

```sh
codex-cheap "In this repo, inspect X and report Y. Do not edit files."
codex-cheap "In this repo, implement X exactly as specified, then run focused verification."
```

Default model is `openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7-flash`. To try GLM-5.2:

```sh
CODEX_CHEAP_MODEL=openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.2 codex-cheap "task"
```
